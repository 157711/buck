{call buck.command}
{param overview}
Builds and runs the tests for one or more specified targets:

<pre>buck test &#x2F;/javatests/com/example:tests</pre>


{/param}

{param params}
{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'all' /}
  {param desc}
  If specified, BUCK will run all tests available in the tree.
 {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'code-coverage' /}
  {param desc}
  Collects code coverage information while running tests.  Currently, this only
  works with Java using <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">emma</a>.  After
  running:

  <pre>buck test --all --code-coverage</pre>

  <p>

  The code coverage information can be found in:

  <pre>buck-out/gen/emma/coverage/</pre>
 {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'debug' /}
  {param desc}
  If specified, the tests will start suspended with a JDWP debug port of 5005. 
  This means that they will not run until a debugger is attached.
 {/param}
{/call}


{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'include' /}
  {param desc}
  Test labels to run with this test.  Labels are a way to group together tests
  of a particular type and run them together.  For example, a developer could
  mark all tests that run in less than 100 milliseconds with
  the <code>fast</code> label, and then use:

  <pre>buck test --all --include fast</pre>

  to run only fast tests. See <a href="{ROOT}rule/java_test.html"><code>{sp}
  java_test()</code></a> for more details.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'exclude' /}
  {param desc}
  The inverse of <code>include</code>.  Labels specified with the exclude option
  won't be run.  For example, if we wanted to run all tests except slow ones, we
  would run:

  <pre>buck test --all --exclude slow</pre>
 {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'test-selectors' /}
  {param alias: 'filter' /}
  {param desc}
    Select tests to run by name, using a <code>class#method</code> syntax.  All
    other tests will not be run and test result caching is disabled:

    <pre>buck test --all --test-selectors 'com.example.MyTest#testX'</pre>

    Matching is done using <code>java.util.regex</code> regular expressions,
    and the class part (or method) part can be omitted to match all classes (or
    methods).

    <pre>buck test --all --filter 'Foo.*'  # ...every class starting Foo</pre>
    <pre>buck test --all --filter '#testX' # ...run testX in every class</pre>

    You can exclude tests with <code>!</code>, and if all your test selectors
    are exclusive, then the default is to run everything except those tests:

    <pre>buck test --all --test-selectors '!MyTest'  # ...all except MyTest</pre>

    The first matching selector decides whether to include or exclude a test.
    The full logic is described in the <code>--help</code>.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'num-threads' /}
  {param desc}
  The number of threads that buck should use when executing the
  build. This defaults to 1.25 times the number of processors in the
  system (on systems with hyperthreading, this means that each core is
  counted twice).

  The number of active threads may not always be equal to this
  argument.
 {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'verbose' /}
  {param alias: 'v'/}
  {param desc}
  How verbose logging to the console should be, with 1 as the minimum
  and 10 as the most verbose.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'xml' /}
  {param desc}
  If specified, Buck will write the test results as XML to the location
  specified.  For example:

  <pre>buck test --all --xml testOutput.xml</pre>
