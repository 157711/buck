  # Because the bulk of the logic to test in JavaDepsFinder requires a TargetGraph,
  # and it is considerably easier to define a TargetGraph by creating sample projects
  # under testdata/ than it is to  construct one programmatically, it makes
  # sense to use Buck's integration test framework to verify JavaDepsFinder rather
  # than a conventional unit test. Since the integration test framework is generally
  # driven by running a Buck subcommand, it makes sense for AutodepsCommandIntegrationTest
  # to be responsible for verifying JavaDepsFinder.
